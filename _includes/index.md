## Sawasdee krub! Hello!

![profile_pic](/assets/profile_image2.jpg)

My name is Chawin Sitawarin. I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science
at UC Berkeley. I am in the security group and advised by [Prof. David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection between machine learning and computer security (because when you add an adversary, things become more challenging and fun). Most of my current and previous works are in the domain of adversarial machine learning, particularly adversarial examples and robustness of machine learning algorithms.

Previously, I graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 2018. I am very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/), [Prof. Peter Ramadge](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/ramadge/doku.html), and [Prof. Alejandro Rodriguez](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/arodriguez/).
