Hello! My name is Chawin Sitawarin. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am in the security group and advised by [Prof. David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection between machine learning and computer security. Most of my current and previous works are in the domain of adversarial machine learning, particularly adversarial examples and robustness of machine learning algorithms.

Previously, I graduated from Princeton University in 2018 where I was very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/), [Prof. Peter Ramadge](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/ramadge/doku.html), and [Prof. Alejandro Rodriguez](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/arodriguez/).

### News

- I interned at IBM Research (Yorktown Heights, NY) over the summer of 2019.
- I kept track and wrote summary of papers on adversarial examples, but I stopped after the number of papers has become overwhelming. I can no longer keep track of a list that is representative of the whole area. You can still find the list at [link](https://github.com/chawins/Adversarial-Examples-Reading-List) (last updated: Sep, 2019).
