Hello! My name is Chawin Sitawarin. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley where I'm part of [the security group](https://security.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD)](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/). I'm advised by [Prof. David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection between machine learning and computer security. Most of my current and previous works are in the domain of adversarial machine learning, particularly adversarial examples and robustness of machine learning algorithms.

Previously, I graduated from Princeton University in 2018 where I was very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/), [Prof. Peter Ramadge](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/ramadge/doku.html), and [Prof. Alejandro Rodriguez](http://faculty.ee.princeton.edu/arodriguez/).

### News

- [Mar 2021] Our paper, "Mitigating Adversarial Training Instability with Batch Normalization," is accepted to [ICLR 2021 Workshop on Security and Safety in Machine Learning Systems](https://aisecure-workshop.github.io/aml-iclr2021/). This work is led by [Arvind Sridhar](https://www.arvindpsridhar.com/), an undergraduate student I mentor at UC Berkeley.
- [Dec 2020] Our project was awarded a grant from Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity (CLTC) for 2021.
- [Aug 2019] I was fortunate to intern at IBM Research (Yorktown Heights, NY) over the summer of 2019 and to be mentored by [Supriyo Chakraborty](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-supriyo).
- I kept track and wrote summary of papers on adversarial examples, but I stopped after the number of papers has become overwhelming. You can still find the list [here](https://github.com/chawins/Adversarial-Examples-Reading-List) (last update: Sep 2019).
